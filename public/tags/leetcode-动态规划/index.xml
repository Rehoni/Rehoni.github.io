Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.
Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.</description>

      <description>69. Sqrt(x)
Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.
Example 1:
Input: 4 Output: 2  Example 2:
Input: 8 Output: 2 Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.</description>
